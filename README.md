Digsite Halo 2 E3 2003 Tagset:
https://github.com/digsite/H2E3

Retail:

1tap/Combined_0 = Very Sharp, Aliasing-free, Stencil-like shadowing. more dramatic shadows and stylized lighting

3tap/Combined_1 = Very soft, less accurate shadowing. perfect for soft lighting 

Note: The E3 version of the Shaders are specifically for the E3 2003 Tagset. Nothing different, but the files are flipped for E3. IE: 1tap/Combined_0 is soft shadowing rather than sharp and vice versa.
